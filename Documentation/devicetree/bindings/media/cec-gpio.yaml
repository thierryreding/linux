title: HDMI CEC GPIO driver

maintainers:

description: |
  The HDMI CEC GPIO module supports CEC implementations where the CEC line is hooked up to a pull-
  up GPIO line and - optionally - the HPD line is hooked up to another GPIO line.

  Please note: the maximum voltage for the CEC line is 3.63V, for the HPD and 5V lines it is 5.3V.
  So you may need some sort of level conversion circuitry when connecting them to a GPIO line.

properties:
  compatible:
    const: cec-gpio

  cec-gpios:
    description: Reference to the GPIO that the CEC line is connected to. The line should be
      tagged as open drain.

  hpd-gpios:
    description: Reference to the GPIO that the HPD is connected to. This property is optional and
      can be used for debugging HPD changes.

  v5-gpios:
    description: Reference to the GPIO that the 5V line is connected to. This property is optional
      and can be used for debugging changes on the 5V line.

  # the GPIO pin header, the HPD line is connected to pin 11 aka BCM17 and the 5V line is
  # connected to pin 15 aka BCM22 (some level shifter is needed for the HPD and 5V lines!)

description:
  The Tegra XUSB pad controller manages a set of I/O lanes (with differential
  signals) which connect directly to pins/pads on the SoC package. Each lane
  is controlled by a HW block referred to as a "pad" in the Tegra hardware
  documentation. Each such "pad" may control either one or multiple lanes,
  and thus contains any logic common to all its lanes. Each lane can be
  separately configured and powered up.

  Some of the lanes are high-speed lanes, which can be used for PCIe, SATA or
  super-speed USB. Other lanes are for various types of low-speed, full-speed
  or high-speed USB (such as UTMI, ULPI and HSIC). The XUSB pad controller
  contains a software-configurable mux that sits between the I/O controller
  ports (e.g. PCIe) and the lanes.

  In addition to per-lane configuration, USB 3.0 ports may require additional
  settings on a per-board basis.

  Pads will be represented as children of the top-level XUSB pad controller
  device tree node. Each lane exposed by the pad will be represented by its
  own subnode and can be referenced by users of the lane using the standard
  PHY bindings, as described by the phy-bindings.txt file in this directory.

  The Tegra hardware documentation refers to the connection between the XUSB
  pad controller and the XUSB controller as "ports". This is confusing since
  "port" is typically used to denote the physical USB receptacle. The device
  tree binding in this document uses the term "port" to refer to the logical
  abstraction of the signals that are routed to a USB receptacle (i.e. a PHY
  for the USB signal, the VBUS power supply, the USB 2.0 companion port for
  USB 3.0 receptacles, ...).

  pads:
    description: A required child node named "pads" contains a list of
      subnodes, one for each of the pads exposed by the XUSB pad controller.
      Each pad may need additional resources that can be referenced in its
      pad node.

      The "status" property is used to enable or disable the use of a pad.
      If set to "disabled", the pad will not be used on the given board. In
      order to use the pad and any of its lanes, this property must be set
      to "okay".

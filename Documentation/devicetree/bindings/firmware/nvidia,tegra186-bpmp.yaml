title: NVIDIA Tegra186 (and later) Boot and Power Management Processor (BPMP)

description: |
  The BPMP is a specific processor in Tegra chip, which is designed for
  booting process handling and offloading the power management, clock
  management, and reset control tasks from the CPU. The binding document
  defines the resources that would be used by the BPMP firmware driver,
  which can create the interprocessor communication (IPC) between the
  CPU and BPMP.

  The BPMP implements some services which must be represented by separate
  nodes. For example, it can provide access to certain I2C controllers, and
  the I2C bindings represent each I2C controller as a device tree node. Such
  nodes should be nested directly inside the main BPMP node.

  Software can determine whether a child node of the BPMP node represents a
  device by checking for a compatible property. Any node with a compatible
  property represents a device that can be instantiated. Nodes without a
  compatible property may be used to provide configuration information
  regarding the BPMP itself, although no such configuration nodes are
  currently defined by this binding.

  The BPMP firmware defines no single global name-/numbering-space for such
  services. Put another way, the numbering scheme for I2C buses is distinct
  from the numbering scheme for any other service the BPMP may provide (e.g.
  a future hypothetical SPI bus service). As such, child device nodes will
  have no "reg" property, and the BPMP node will have no "#address-cells" or
  "#size-cells" property.

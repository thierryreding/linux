  ahb-burst-config:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description: This vendor-dependent property is used to change the AHB burst configuration and
      should be aligned with AHBBRST at SBUSCFG. See the ChipIdea specification for the details on
      each of those values. If this property does not exist, the reset value will be used.
    minimum: 0
    maximum: 7

  tx-burst-size-dword:
    description: This vendor-dependent property is used to configure the TX burst size (in 32-bit
      words). The value represents the maximum length of a burst while moving data from system
      memory to the USB bus. This property takes effect only if the "ahb-burst-config" property is
      set to 0. If this property is missing the reset default of the hardware implementation will
      be used.

  rx-burst-size-dword:
    description: This vendor-dependent property is used to configure the RX burst size (in 32-bit
      words). This value represents the maximum length of a burst while moving data from the USB
      bus to system memory. This property takes effect only if the "ahb-burst-config" property is
      set to 0. If this property is missing the reset default of the hardware implementation will
      be used.

  extcon:
    description: A list of phandles to external connector devices. The first phandle should point
      to the external connector which provides "USB" cable events. The second should point to the
      external connector device that provide "USB-HOST" cable events. If one of the external
      connector devices is not required, an empty phandle (0) should be specified.

  phy-clkgate-delay-us:
    description: The delay time (in microseconds) between putting the PHY into low power mode and
      gating the PHY clock.

  non-zero-ttctrl-ttha:
    description: |
      After setting this property, the value of register ttctrl.ttha will be 0x7f; if not, the
      value will be 0x0 (the default). The value for this property needs to be chosen very
      carefully after consulting with your IC engineer.

      On most ChipIdea platforms, the "usage_tt" flag at RTL is 0, so this property only affects
      siTD.

      If this property is not set, the maximum packet size is 1023 bytes, and if the total packet
      size for previous transactions is more than 256 bytes, no further transactions can be
      accepted within the frame. The use case is single transaction, but higher frame rate.

      If this property is set, the maximum packet size is limited to 188 bytes and more
      transactions than in the above case can be handled. Transactions will be accepted as long as
      188 bytes or more of space are left within a frame. Software needs to make sure it does not
      send more than 90% maximum_periodic_data_per_frame. The use case is higher amount of
      transactions at the cost of a lower frame rate.

  mux-controls:
    description: The mux control for toggling host/device output of this controller. It's expected
      that a mux state of 0 indicates device mode and a mux state of 1 indicates host mode.

  mux-control-names:
    const: usb_switch

  pinctrl-names:
    description: In case of HSIC-mode, "idle" and "active" pin modes are mandatory. In this case,
      the "idle" state needs to pull down the data and strobe pin and the "active" state needs to
      pull up the strobe pin.

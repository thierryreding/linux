description: |
  This module is part of the Palmas family of PMICs. For more details about the whole chip see:

    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/ti,palmas.yaml

  This module provides a simple power button event via an interrupt.

properties:
  compatible:
    const: ti,palmas-pwrbutton

  interrupts:
    maxItems: 1

  wakeup-source:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/flag
    description: Enables wake up of host system on power button press.

  ti,palmas-long-press-seconds:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description: |
      Duration in seconds which the power button should be kept pressed for Palmas to power off
      automatically.

      NOTE: This depends on OTP support and POWERHOLD signal configuration on platform.
    enum: [ 6, 8, 10, 12 ]

  ti,palmas-pwron-debounce-milli-seconds:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description: |
      Duration in milliseconds which the power button should be kept pressed for Palmas to
      register a press for debouncing purposes. NOTE: This depends on specific Palmas variation
      capability.

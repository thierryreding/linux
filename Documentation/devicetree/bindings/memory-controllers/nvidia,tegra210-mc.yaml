title: NVIDIA Tegra210 SoC Memory Controller

description: |
  The NVIDIA Tegra210 SoC features a 64 bit memory controller that is split into two 32 bit
  channels to support LPDDR3 and LPDDR4 with x16 subpartitions. The MC handles memory requests for
  34-bit virtual addresses from internal clients and arbitrates among them to allocate memory
  bandwidth.

  Up to 8 GiB of physical memory can be supported. Security features such as encryption of traffic
  to and from DRAM via general security apertures are available for video and other secure
  applications.

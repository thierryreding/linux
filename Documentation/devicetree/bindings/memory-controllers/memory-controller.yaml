description: |
  The memory access hierarchy in a modern device can be fairly complicated.
  Accesses to system memory typically end up going through a memory controller
  that ensures that data is stored. Along the way, these accesses can undergo
  classification and be prioritized and/or arbitrated.

  The interconnect bindings (see ../interconnect/interconnect.txt) provides a
  way of describing the data paths between devices and system memory. However
  these interconnect paths, in order to be most flexible, describe the paths
  in a very fine-grained way, so situations can arise where it is no longer
  possible to derive a unique memory parent for any given device.

  In order to remove such potential ambiguities, a memory controller can be
  specified in device tree. A memory controller specified in this way will be
  used as the DMA parent for a given device. The memory controller defines a
  memory bus via the "dma-ranges" property, which will in turn be used to set
  the range of memory accessible to DMA children of the memory controller.

  "#memory-controller-cells": true
  dma-ranges: true
